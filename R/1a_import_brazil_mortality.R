# #Hi Dan,
# 
# #I believe the best alternative for Brazil and Chile is option 3, considering Date of Death â€“ Date of birth.
# 
# #For Mexico they will not have the DOB variable (as they consider this personal identified and thus are not allowed to extract/share). But there age will have already be calculated prior to extraction so we should be good.

#   Subject: Age variables
# 
# 
# 
# Hi Cris,
# 
# Can you confirm which age variable we should use for Brazil and Chile? 
#   
#   We can 
# 
# 1) use the edad variable itself
# 
# 2) use edad combined with edad tipo
# 
# 3) calculate manually from DOB and date of death
# 
# 
# 
# I was trying #2, but it seems the edad_tipo variable is maybe not using the same definition for Brazil and Chile (it seem maybe right for Brazil, though there is a category 1 and 9, which I wasn't sure what these are. 9=missing? 1= hours?; for Chile, most people have edad_tipo=1
